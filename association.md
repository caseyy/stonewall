#### OVERVIEW ####

The Stonewall Community Association was formally organized to preserve and promote improvements within the community. The Stonewall Association Board conducts the business of the Association and facilitates communication among all residents. A Neighborhood Association is different than a Homeowner's Association, in that membership is not required. The absence of a Homeowner's Association within the Stonewall Community also means the absence of stringent requirements and high cost of mandatory dues for homeowners. 

Association Board members are residents that volunteer a great deal of time toward community events, activities, and resident concerns. The Board also works directly with various departments of the city of Lexington, working toward continuous improvements to ensure that Stonewall remains a safe and beautiful environment in which to live.


#### PURPOSE & OBJECTIVE ####

The association is organized to promote, preserve, and improve the neighborhood, by means of informational exchange and civic, social, and advocatory activities. 


#### BENEFITS OF MEMBERSHIP ####

Annual membership dues are only $25 per household. By becoming a member, you are supporting Stonewall in many ways, some of which include: 

1. Beautification projects within the neighborhood and ongoing maintenance, such as the new entrance on Cindy Blair Way.
1. Annual events for all residents, such as the neighborhood Independence Day Parade, Ice Cream Social, Community Yard Sale, etc. 
1. Communication costs including our quarterly newsletter, this website; special mailings and signage to alert all residents of current issues or events. 
1. Association members can sign up for automatic e-mail messages related to the community. While our website will be continually updated to provide information related to all residents, Association members may receive the added benefit of receiving early alerts and notifications between newsletters. 
1. Association members are also entitled to a free e-mail account @stonewallinfo.com. Request an account by sending a message to your webmaster.
