Residents of the Stonewall community are fortunate to have several parks conveniently located either within or just outside our neighborhood. 

#### Stonewall Park

Stonewall Park is located beside Stonewall Elementary School on Cornwall Drive. This park is designated as a passive use park, with focus on natural surroundings and native plants. It was previously known as "Stonewall Historic Nature Park". 

The 9 acre park features a paved trail of just over a half mile. Recent improvements to the park include a new picnic area, a bench, and a swing that were added in 2005. The Stonewall Neighborhood Association worked with LFUCG's Parks and Recreation Department to add these enhanced offerings to park visitors. Trash recepticles are also located in several locations along the trail to help keep the area beautiful.


#### Higbee Mill Park

This neighborhood park has received the most recent and notable improvements. Located on Higbee Mill Road, one of the entrances into our neighborhood from Clays Mill Road, this park encompasses just over 8 acres of land that has primarily been utilized as a practice soccer field. While the soccer goals remain in place, they are now surrounded by the newest of our walking trails, constructed in the fall of 2007. The Stonewall Association contributed with LFUCG's Parks Department to add a couple of benches and a picnic table along the trail for visitors to enjoy. 

In the summer of 2008, construction began on a paved parking area as part of Higbee Mill Park's improvement plans that have been ongoing. Select our Documents link at left or click here, and then select the Higbee Mill Park Plan link to view a formal rendering of planned improvements. A photo will be available soon. 



#### Wellingtion Park

Wellington Park is located at the corner of Clays Mill Road and the newly extended portion of Wellington Way, bordering New Circle Road. Also designed with the intention of passive use, the primary focus of this new park when complete will be on native plantings and walking trails. 

While Wellington Park is currently little more than open fields, recent improvements for the 38 acre park include formal signage, a dog run, and parking area. Future plans include additional walking trails as part the city's Healthway initiative. A Rain Garden Study also began in spring, 2008, with partial funding provided by the Stonewall Neighborhood Association. 


Our Neighborhood Association continues to work with the LFUCG Division of Parks and Recreation to achieve these planned improvements and will publish updates regarding Wellington Park to this website as they become available. 



#### Shillito Park

The main entrance to Shillito Park is accessible from Reynolds Road, directly behind Fayette Mall; across from Meijer. Additionally, a second entrance is available through the neighboring Monticello subdivision. 

There are enough facilities available in Shillito to keep your family active for an entire day. At just over 135 acres, this park is the largest in the Stonewall area. 

Restroom facilities are available at various locations within the park. There is a public swimming pool, as well as a great playground for younger children, depicted in this photo. 

Several picnic areas (some sheltered) are scattered throughout the park, and many also include grills. There are baseball/softball fields, basketball and tennis courts. There are an abundance of open fields for you to choose your own activities, and nearly a mile of paved trail on which to walk or run. Additional trail connections, including the one recently constructed along Reynold Road, are also underway as part of Lexington's Healthway intiative.
