Our annual Stonewall ice cream social will be held from 3 to 5 pm on Saturday, September 6 on the grounds of Stonewall Elementary School. After the forced cancellation of last year's social because of school construction, we were reluctant to schedule the event before Labor Day to ensure that all construction activities would be out of the way. We will serve free ice cream.

This year, however, we are going for a bit more involvement by attendees. Will you please bring the toppings? If your street address is even, please bring a non-homemade syrup or whipped cream; odds, bring (store bought) candy sprinkles - but NO NUTS because of the possible allergies. Bring a chair for your own seating, as we cannot count on benches being available in the school's new areas.

We'll have music via a disc jockey again this year, and there will be inflatables, face painting, and a basketball toss for the kiddies. Cornhole and possibly some competitions will entertain older kids. We are also looking for some adults to help with the games (email stonewallweb@gmail.com). Come on out for a good time.
