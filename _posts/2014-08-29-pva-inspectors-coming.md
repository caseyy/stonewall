Current inspections by the PVA Office include Stonewall Estates and Stonewall Equestrian (NOT Grasmere, Indian Hills, Wellington this year!) These inspections are currently under way and will continue through the end of 2014. The PVA is required by law to inspect every parcel at least once every four years. An assessor from the Fayette County PVA Office will visit each property, take a new photograph and look for changes since the previous inspection.

Resassessment does not mean increases in property taxes automatically, by the way; Stonewall's assessment to sales price ratio is 96 percent for the past year, which means that values are likely to stay the same except in unusual cases. Fear not!

PVA staff do not access the insides of homes but by law may enter back yards to inspect additions or improvements. See more at http://www.fayette-pva.com. Assessors always perform neighborhood inspections in marked state cars and will identify themselves as PVA staff.
