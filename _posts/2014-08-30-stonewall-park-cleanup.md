Have you walked in Stonewall Park lately? Doesn't it look wonderful and cared for? What has happened is that much of the dense invasive foliage has been cut from the back of the park by Robert Blankenship and his crew of chainsaw-wielding Stonewallians.

It happened this way: May 10 was reserved by Stonewall Community Association as the day for the Great American Cleanip in the park, and as some of us stood in the puring rain that morning with a contingent of helpers with heavy equipment from the Parks and Recreation, we postponed the cleanup. For several years, we have been trying to make the park more useful and attractive by cutting tons of bush honeysuckle that threatens the park. A very rainy summer in 2013 made it infeasible to have a cleanup, so the plant got a year free from being cut and did an especially efficient job of taking over much of the park.

Robert, Stonewall Community Association's coordinator of park activities, was determined that wouldn't happen again. Robert made a deal with Parks: He would see to it that the honeysuckle got cut if Parks would agree to haul the cuttings away. And this is precisely what has happened. For several weeks, Robert has led a small team of willing residents in cutting thos persistent bushes and moving the debris to the sidewalk. Later, P&R has made them disappear. We owe a hearty thanks to Robert and his crew as well as to Parks for the results that we can all enjoy. Take a walk in the park and see for yourself.
