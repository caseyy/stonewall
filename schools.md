This page contains information regarding schools in the Stonewall area.

#### Stonewall Elementary School

Stonewall Elementary School is conveniently located in the heart of Stonewall on Cornwall Drive. The elementary school is within walking distance for many of our neighborhood's children and several generations of our neighborhood's residents have once attended. 

Because of its convenient location, Stonewall Elementary is also a popular meeting site for many of our Association's activities and events, including the Annual Neighborhood meeting, Ice Cream Social, and Independence Day parade. 

On behalf of all residents, the Stonewall Neighborhood Association extends its gratitude to Stonewall Elementary for allowing the use of its facilities and grounds.

#### Jessie Clark Middle School

Built in 1963, Jessie Clark Middle School is located on Clays Mill Road between Keithshire Way and Beth Lane. 

According to the FCPS website, the school "was named for Mrs. Jessie McFarland Clark. Mrs. Clark was the first woman elected to the school board in 1948, and those who knew her say she was something! She made it possible for the school to have the oldest school bell in Fayette County. It is mounted in front of Jessie Clark today."
