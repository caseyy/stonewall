The Stonewall Community Association has formally implemented a Safety Watch program in conjunction with the LFUCG Division of Police. The project began in 2006, with information gathering and block captain assignments completed in 2007. 

Each residence is assigned a Block Captain to serve as a central point of contact regarding any reported crimes and/or suspicious activity in the neighborhood. Residents should always contact the police to report criminal activities or general concerns. However, by taking the additional step of informing your designated Block Captain, we can utilize our communications protocol to alert all residents to be on the lookout. 

With over 1000 residences within the Stonewall neighborhood, this project has been a tremendous undertaking and we appreciate the efforts of our Safety Watch Director, former Association President, and Newsletter Editor, Don Starsinic as well as Board Member Harold O'Donnell for their dedication and leadership to our community. Don and Harold are Stonewall's Safety Watch Leaders. 

Contact Don by phone at 224-8017 or e-mail him at dstarsinic@stonewallinfo.com.  
Contact Harold by phone at 224-9459 or e-mail him at hodonnell@stonewallinfo.com.

Our list of Safety Watch Block Captain Assignments is available in the [Documents]({{ "/documents" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) section of our website.

#### Volunteers Needed

There are still two areas within Stonewall that are currently not covered in the Safety Watch Program as there is no available Block Captain to assign. If you wish to participate, please contact Don Starsinic.
