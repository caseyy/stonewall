		<h1>Welcome to Stonewall</h1>
		<p>Located only minutes from downtown Lexington, the Stonewall neighborhood is also close to major shopping venues such as Fayette Mall and Beaumont Centre as well as its own Stonewall Center. Our neighborhood is bordered by Clays Mill and Harrodsburg Roads, from New Circle Road to Man O' War Road.<br /><br />

Although the area is comprised of mostly ranch-style homes, diversity abounds with two-story, split level, and contemporary architectural styles as well. With over a thousand homes, Stonewall is one of the largest neighborhoods in Lexington, a neighborhood that sees many of our residents living here for a lifetime.  Our community association leaders strive to encourage involvement and awareness through events, activities, our quarterly newsletter, and this web site.</p>
